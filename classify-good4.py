Well, friends told her this and friends told her that But friends don't choose what echoes in your head When she got bored with all the idle chit-and-chat Kept thinking 'bout what he said I'll swim even when the water's cold That's the one thing that I know Even when the water's cold She remembers it fondly, she doesn't remember it all But what she does, she sees clearly She lost his number, and he never called But all she really lost was an earring The other's in a box with others she has lost I wonder if she still hears me I'll swim even when the water's cold That's the one thing that I know Even when the water's cold If you believe in love You know that sometimes it isn't Do you believe in love? Then save the bullshit questions Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't Sometimes it's just how the light hits their eyes Do you believe in love?"
